## Creating Images

After running all experiments, to generate the images from the paper, 

1. Run the Matlab script ```extractCSVSubset``` to obtain the appropriate filenames for fast compliation of images.

2. Open the file ```tikz_standalone.tex``` in your favorite LaTeX editor. You can comment the file you want to compile.  Files are numbered to match the paper.
